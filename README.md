# Bank_Customer_Churn

The bank customer churn predictive model project aimed to develop a model to predict customer churn using a dataset available at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/louishgy/churn-modelling. The project followed these key steps:

Data Collection: The dataset was obtained from the provided Kaggle link, which contained information about bank customers.

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Necessary data preprocessing steps were performed, which likely included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing any data inconsistencies or outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): An exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the dataset. This step likely involved visualizations, summary statistics, and identifying patterns or trends in the data.

Inferences and Insights: From the EDA, inferences about the data and potential factors influencing customer churn were made. These insights helped in better understanding the dataset.

Data Visualization: Data visualizations, such as plots and graphs, were created to illustrate key findings and patterns in the data. Visualizations can help convey complex information in a more understandable manner.

Feature Importance: The importance of different features or variables in predicting customer churn was determined. This helps identify which factors have the most influence on the outcome.

Model Building: Four different machine learning models were built to predict customer churn. These models were likely trained and tested using appropriate techniques, and their performance was evaluated using various metrics.

Model Evaluation: The models were evaluated based on several metrics, including:

Train Accuracy: How well the model performs on the training data.
Test Accuracy: How well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.
ROC Score: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) score, which measures the model's ability to discriminate between classes.
Specificity: The proportion of true negatives correctly identified by the model.
Sensitivity: The proportion of true positives correctly identified by the model.
F1-weighted Average: A weighted average of the F1 score, which balances precision and recall.
Model Comparison: The performance of the four models was compared based on the evaluation metrics. This step likely helped select the best-performing model for the task of predicting customer churn.

The model consdered were Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and XGB Classifier. The models were assessed based on their accuracy, ability to discriminate between classes, and other relevant metrics. The RandomForestClassifier and XGBClassifier models appear to have performed well, with high test accuracy and ROC scores.
